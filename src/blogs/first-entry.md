This is my first entry using markdown file.

<br/>
I'm just gonna talk about how I develop my own personal website. Since I'm using Gatsby, I'll optimize the SEO feature for this website, no real reason why, but I'm gonna implement it so it looks professional :). This took me about 3 days in total (working hours, if you want to know the detail) to build this website from scratch, for styling I choose tailwindcss since I want this website to finish quick. Let's see this website is still under development because I'll update and implement some other things too here.
<br/>
<br/>

Enough for technical chit chat, since now, I'm gonna start to write anything that I'm interested in. Both in Bahasa Indonesia or in English (if I'm in the mood?) for my own documentation surely, and **_you_**, if you visit this website and have interest in reading my blogs, I'll appreciate it more.
<br/>
<br/>

Anything that comes to mind, I'm gonna express it here, **_yes, anything_**. Hopefully, I will not lack of motivation in doing this routinely.

Here's a picture of a mango juice, because at this time I'd really wanna drink one.
